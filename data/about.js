# MLP models

Multi-Layer Perceptron models, are a type of artificial neural network that can be used for supervised learning tasks,
such as regression or classification problems. MLP models are good for finding general trends in data for several reasons.

MLP models are highly flexible and can learn complex non-linear relationships between input features and output targets. 
his makes them suitable for a wide range of tasks, including forecasting.

# Input data

The input data is a list of numbers, separated by commas. The input data is used to train the model, and the model will
predict the next value in the sequence.

Example: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

# Lookback window

The lookback window size is the number of values that the model will use to predict the next value in the sequence. The
lookback size must be less than the number of values in the input data.

Example: 2

# Prediction range

The prediction range is the number of values that the model will predict. The forecast range must be less than the number of
values in the input data.

Example: 5

# Chart

The chart shows the input data, and the predicted values. The predicted values are the values that the model predicts for
the next values in the sequence. The predicted values are shown in shades of orange, and many predicted values can be shown
at once.
